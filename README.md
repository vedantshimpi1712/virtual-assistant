# AI Virtual Assistant

This is an AI virtual assistant project that I developed using Python and its libraries. The assistant can perform a variety of tasks such as answering questions, providing information, and executing basic commands. The project leverages several Python libraries to handle natural language processing, speech recognition, and task automation. It was an exciting way to explore the capabilities of AI and enhance my programming skills. Feel free to explore the code, test the assistant, and leave your feedback!üòÅ :-)
